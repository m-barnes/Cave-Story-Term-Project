# Cave Story Term Project
 Term Project for Structured Programming C++
 
 The Cave Story Term Project is a project that was put together for the Structured Programming / C++ class. It's derived from a project originally found on Reddit by Mark Guerra (u/Limeoats). The project was adopted to fit into a full term academic semester and was used as a supplimentary project to the weekly coursework. A number of videos that included lectures on basic C++ and programming concepts and constructs accompanied the project.
 
 Many thanks to Daisuke Amaya for creating the game, Mark Guerra for putting together the orginal project, and the community at /r/Limeoats for all their help in adapting and expanding it.
